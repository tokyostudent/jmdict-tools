============

Various tools for working with JMDict
The JMDict project by Jim Breen is a great, open Japanese-English dictionary. The dictionary is provided free in an XML file.
The file format is not straightforward and may confuse first time and even intermediate users. Moreover, creating
a dictionary application is harder than it could be, since all aspects of the XML file need to be accounted for.

The goal of this project, is to create a simple to use API so developers could concentrate on providing better
end user experience.

This README is sorely lacking in information and form - will be updated soon...
